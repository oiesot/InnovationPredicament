## Shunde's Technology Support Turns into Harvesting Leeks: Rent Subsidies Become High-Interest Loans (Part 1)

Shenzhen Chaosuan Science & Development Co., Ltd.(深圳市超算科技开发有限公司), located in the Nanshan District of Shenzhen, specializes in artificial intelligence and data sectors. The firm has filed for over 30 invention patents across a spectrum of technology areas and has garnered multiple prestigious accolades, including being recognized as a leading AI enterprise and a National High-Tech Enterprise. Collaborating with The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the company has developed an award-winning data-driven intelligent operation system for HVAC systems, highlighting its commitment to pioneering and eco-friendly technological solutions.

Shenzhen Shunchuang Industry Accelerator Service Co., Ltd.（深圳顺创产业加速器服务有限公司）and Shunde Angel Co-investment Talent Development Fund Co., Ltd.（佛山市顺德区天使联投人才发展基金有限公司）are enterprises under the Shunde Science and Innovation Group（顺德科创集团）, established by the Shunde District Committee and District Government as investment platform companies to support technological innovation.

Shenzhen Shunchuang Industry Accelerator and Shunde Angel Co-investment, under the guise of supporting innovative enterprises and attracting talents from the Greater Bay Area to settle in Shunde, have actually adopted the method of significantly increasing the rent before offering subsidies as a means to profit. The ruthlessness of their operation is reminiscent of the infamous 'Pig Butchering Scam' in Northern Myanmar. The company is not only suspected of using subsidized rent as a means to invest through actual debts under the guise of equity, essentially high-interest lending, but also of covertly controlling and restricting enterprises through these means, the greedy and cunning nature of which is shocking.

All of this deviates from the original intention and the principles of supporting innovation, delivering a heavy blow and warning to enterprises seeking development. The experience of Shenzhen supercomputing is a profound reflection on those policies and entities that have not been scrutinized behind the halo, as well as an awakening for entrepreneurs and investors. It serves as a reminder for entrepreneurs to be more cautious when seeking funding and partners, ensuring that both parties' interests and strategic goals are truly aligned. At the same time, it also reveals the complexities that state capital might bring into the equity structure of private enterprises. This is not only a test for Shenzhen supercomputing but also a reflection on the entire venture capital ecosystem.

Shenzhen Chaosuan Science & Development Co., Ltd. initially paid about 70 RMB per square meter for rent and property fees at the Shenzhen International Student Entrepreneurship Building. In 2017, the Shunde Technology Bureau promised to provide support for technological innovation after expert review and requested Shenzhen Chaosuan Science & Development Co., Ltd. to relocate to the Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator in Shenzhen. However, after relocation, it was discovered that the accelerator had not completed fire safety approval and had not been notified in advance, leading to long-term delays in obtaining rent subsidies and unforeseen legal risks. After the fire safety approval was obtained, the lease and investment agreement proposed by the accelerator was surprisingly high: the rent was equivalent to 220 RMB per square meter per month, with a planned annual increase of 10%, and additional costs, raising the monthly average cost to 300 RMB per square meter, higher than both the Entrepreneurship Building and most non-incubator spaces on the market.

According to the "rent-for-investment" strategy implemented by the Shenzhen Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator, office space was rented to Supercomputing at 150 RMB per square meter for two years, prohibiting withdrawal from the lease during this period, and the difference in rent over the two years was converted into about 2.3 million RMB of equity investment. Shunde Angel Co-investment then made a cash investment under similar terms, while also demanding a signed appreciation repurchase agreement. During the agreement signing process, there was controversy over the repurchase clause and its conflict with the commitment to support innovation. At that time, Zhang Jun, the person in charge of Shunchuang (who has since resigned), assured that this was merely part of the state capital process and stated that the industrial accelerator had no actual financial outlay, so no repurchase would occur, and the accelerator would not trouble its incubated enterprises.

Out of recognition for Shunde's technology innovation strategy, trust in state capital, and admiration for Shunde's pioneering spirit, Shenzhen Supercomputing signed the agreement after inspecting Shunde, based on support and trust in the Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator.

During the two years of incubation, Shenzhen Supercomputing fulfilled its financial obligations, paying a total of about 3 million RMB in rent and service fees to the Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator with no arrears. Shenzhen Supercomputing even conceded on the several hundred thousand RMB in service fees overcharged due to the accelerator's miscalculation, converting it into a deposit for up to five years to help Shunchuang avoid managerial responsibility.

During the two-year incubation period, Shenzhen Supercomputing consistently met its financial obligations, paying a total of about 3 million RMB in rent and service fees to Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator without any arrears. It even conceded on the several hundred thousand RMB in service fees overcharged due to the accelerator's miscalculation, converting it into a deposit for up to five years to help Shunchuang avoid managerial responsibility.

Despite Shenzhen Supercomputing being introduced as a key project in Shunde and its founder recognized as high-level talent in Shunde, the company and its team did not receive any subsidies or substantial support from Shenzhen Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator or Shunde. During the pandemic, the company did not receive the necessary aid; instead, due to issues with the accelerator, it was forced to relocate offices multiple times, negatively impacting operations and team stability.

Initially, Shunchuang promised to provide the same treatment as local Shunde enterprises, but in practice, the implementation of support measures was repeatedly delayed for various excuses, like the absence of clear support policies or slow development of Shenzhen Supercomputing. The only so-called "resource support" was participation in a few promotional meetings related to Shunde real estate. Post-investment management lacked assessment and understanding of technology development, often shirking responsibility by claiming ignorance, which didn't materially aid the company's development.
These organizations completely ignored Shenzhen Supercomputing's research achievements, such as being recognized as one of China's Top 20 Technology Innovation Enterprises, among the Top 100 AI Enterprises in Shenzhen, an Innovative SME in Shenzhen, and a National High-Tech Enterprise, along with owning over 20 self-invented patents covering AI, distributed encrypted storage, machine learning, data encryption, blockchain, etc. The company values independent R&D and has invested millions with The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for joint research and filed for multiple invention patents, covering AI-driven central air conditioning energy-saving, among others. Post-investment management lacked any substantial evaluation of research and intellectual property, focusing almost entirely on financial data.
After the two-year incubation period ended, according to the agreement, Shenzhen Supercomputing should move out of Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator to make space for other startups, a standard practice for incubators. However, conflicting statements arose from Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator and Shunde Angel Co-investment. Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator asked Shenzhen Supercomputing to move out according to the agreement, while Shunde Angel Co-investment suddenly demanded that Shenzhen Supercomputing continue renting the accelerator space and paying rent, despite the financial pressures to adhere to the agreement. Finally, Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator changed its stance, also demanding continued renting or they would jointly force a share buyback from Shenzhen Supercomputing. As the original team at Shunchuang left, promises and support for innovation were forgotten. Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment changed their claims, suggesting that Shenzhen Supercomputing's presence was more about business attraction, not technology introduction. The company, as a tech firm, wasn't clear on the distinction between "business attraction" and "innovation introduction," but such wordplay typically signifies a breach of promise.

In early 2020, when Shenzhen Supercomputing decided to move out of Shunchuang, not only did Shunchuang withhold Supercomputing's deposit, but it also pressured alongside Shunde Angel Co-investment for a repurchase fee of up to 8.2 million RMB, including converted rental subsidies of 2.3 million RMB and 10% annual interest. During the pandemic, Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment repeatedly demanded repurchases, ignoring the difficulties faced by Supercomputing due to the pandemic and its contributions to Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator and Shunde over the years, including being among the first batch of enterprises to settle in Shunde's Country Garden New Energy Automobile Town.

From 2018 to 2023, Shenzhen Supercomputing negotiated with shareholders including Shenzhen Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment for nearly five years regarding equity change proposals. During this time, Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator and Shunde Angel Co-investment frequently expressed support but could not stamp shareholder resolutions, preventing Shenzhen Supercomputing from meeting potential investment institutions' requirements and missing development opportunities. After three years of the pandemic, Shenzhen Supercomputing was on the verge of collapse, repeatedly mentioning its plight in post-investment and shareholder meetings. Eventually, with the support of most shareholders, Shenzhen Supercomputing initiated an equity change as the first step for a new round of financing. But Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment issued a lawyer's letter claiming complete unawareness of the equity change and again demanded a high repurchase of shares from Shenzhen Supercomputing and its founding team. After Shenzhen Supercomputing pointed out their lies, they kept changing their statements, claiming the demand for repurchase was due to non-recognition of the equity change, and continually sought other reasons for a high-price buyback, essentially finding any excuse to press charges without standing as shareholders.

For survival and reputation, Shenzhen Supercomputing and its shareholders attempted to negotiate a resolution with Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment, but the proposed settlement agreement from the latter was not only harsh but also devoid of any fairness. For example, according to the terms, even if Shenzhen Supercomputing and its shareholders paid the complete share repurchase amount, if the equity change failed due to non-cooperation from Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment, Shenzhen Supercomputing and its shareholders would need to pay an additional 20% penalty to the other party. During negotiations, Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment froze the company and founder's personal funds, forcing Shenzhen Supercomputing to cease operations and lay off all staff, severely impacting operations and facing bankruptcy.

During negotiations to maintain the company's survival and reputation, Shenzhen Supercomputing and its shareholders attempted to negotiate with Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator and Shunde Angel Co-investment, hoping to find a peaceful resolution. However, the proposed settlement not only disregarded their breach of contract responsibilities but was also so harsh as to nearly ignore the principle of fairness. For instance, if the equity change failed due to non-cooperation from Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment, they would not need to assume any breach of contract responsibility, while Shenzhen Supercomputing and its shareholders not only had to bear the full repurchase amount but also had to pay an additional 20% penalty to the other party. This not only neglects the principle of fairness but also betrays the spirit of cooperation.

Even in such difficult circumstances, Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator and Shunde Angel Co-investment still worried about the risks that Shenzhen Supercomputing's future development might bring. They required Shenzhen Supercomputing and its shareholders to propose a solution, ensuring they themselves did not bear any responsibility. This demand was not only unreasonable but also particularly self-serving, ignoring the basic principle that both sides of a partnership should jointly bear risks and responsibilities.
During negotiations, these investors took extreme financial measures, including freezing Shenzhen Supercomputing and its founder's funds, severely hindering the company's daily operations, and cutting off all possible ways to raise funds to solve the repurchase issue. This action ultimately led to Shenzhen Supercomputing having to cease operations and lay off staff, facing the harsh reality of bankruptcy.

These series of problems highlight the inconsistency and unreliability in post-investment management by Shunchuang Industrial Accelerator and Shunde Angel Co-investment. This not only deviates from the essential role of angel investors but also shows predatory exploitation of innovative enterprises. Far from the claimed support and nurturing spirit, their actions are closer to the pursuit of short-term interests and extraction from startups. This not only destroys the trust between investors and entrepreneurs but also severely hampers the healthy development of the entire innovation ecosystem.
